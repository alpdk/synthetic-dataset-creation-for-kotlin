# Synthetic Dataset Creation For Kotlin

## Preparations

### Python packages

For proper work this code will require from user packages:

1. datasets
2. jsonlines
3. peft

For their installation you can run this line in terminal:

```pip install datasets jsonlines peft > /dev/null```

### Kotlinc 

Kotlinc required for running code that was generated by LLM. For setting it up you can run script `setup_kotlinc.py`.

This script has 1 optional parameter:

1. Github link to kotlinc zip archive. (by default: [link](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/download/v2.0.20/kotlin-compiler-2.0.20.zip))

This zip archive will be placed in project directory.

You can run this scrypt like:

1. ```python setup_kotlinc.py```
2. ```python setup_kotlinc.py [link]```

### MXeval

MXeval required for testing generated code. For setting it up run script `setup_mxeval.py`.

This script has 1 optional parameter: 

1. Full path to directory where MXeval will be placed or already placed. (default: project dir) 

You can run this scrypt like:

1. ```python setup_mxeval.py```
2. ```python setup_mxeval.py [path]```

## Test not fine tuned llm model

Before we will start fine tuning llm we need to check what pass rate it has on our testing dataset.
For that you ca run script `generate_model_answer.py`

This script has 2 optional parameters:

1. Name of the model or local path to it. (default: `ibm-granite/granite-3b-code-base-2k` )
2. Dataset for testing. (default: `jetbrains/Kotlin_HumanEval` )

You can run this scrypt like:

1. ```python generate_model_answers.py```
2. ```python generate_model_answers.py [model name/local path]```
3. ```python generate_model_answers.py [model name/local path] [dataset name]```

As a result it will give you a pass rate on tests and file `answer` with results for each test.
